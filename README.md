Service: GeoStatus

Description:
GeoStatus is a web-application to record and monitor infrastructure issues reported by the general public. Using our specially designed software, reports are recorded into a database and pinned on a map accessible to all web users. As a result, residents will stay informed whether the problem they are facing has already been addressed by another client and the status of the repair, allowing residents to feel valued and play a greater role in making their city great.
